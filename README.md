# jaehalee.com

I wanted to upload my portfolio on my own website, so I decided to buy my own damin in my name.
The first step is buying a domain. I chose cloudflare because of low price, easy to control and security features.

I had to connect my html file to my website, so I used cloudflare pages and connected with my GitHub repository.

Deployed my website and connected to my custom domain, which is jaehalee.com. Basically, it is just connecting jaeha.pages.dev to jaehalee.com.

Setting up the DNS Records in my website. Could be better if I have my own server and ip address, but it worked well with pages.
